# Lab 2

#Updates from Dawson Butts

1. This code does a port scan on a given range (start int, end int) and tests to see 
    if these ports are open or closed. This can be used to possibly show what a user 
    is doing, given these specific ports. The code returns the total number of ports 
    scanned (inclusive of both start and end).

2. Modifications include:   Adding the usage and my name at the top comments
                            Adding DialTimeout so the program can run faster
                            Returning -p for a closed port number, rather than 0
                            Adding inputs 'start' and 'end' to scan over just a given range
                            Adding a closedports slice to keep track of those ports as well as the open ones
                            Added the closed ports to the print outs 
                            Sorted the closed ports
                            Returned the total number of ports scanned, not just open ports 

3. Chosen mods for #5: I chose to include more inputs for the port scan. Rather than 
    automatically scanning over 1024 ports, this allows users to specify their start 
    and end ports of what they want to scan. This allows for testing on only specific 
    ports in question and can save time. These inputs are both type 'int', so that the
    function is called 'PortScanner(5, 100)'

1. Update Your Forked Repository
2. Navigate to > materials > lab > 2
3. bhg-scanner folder has
   1. main > main.go : in this folder `go build` then `./main`
   2. scanner > scanner.go and scanner_test.go  : in this folder `go test`
4. Complete the TODO's listed in scanner > scanner.go
5. Make one major other modification to the code; update/add a test or two
6. Update the README file in bhg-scanner that describes, 1 what the code does, modification to the code (based on the todos) AND includes details of the modification you chose to make in #5
