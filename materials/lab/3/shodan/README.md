README for shodan folder

I chose to complete the lab by extending host.go to accept a facets input
along with the query. Facets are used to get summary information of 
properties from searches in Shodan. 

The HostSearch function how accepts (q string, facet string) and can 
further focus users searches. Multiple facets can be entered, as long as it is
one complete string that works for a URL.
